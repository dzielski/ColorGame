**RGB Colors**

This will teach you about colors that are coded as RGB numbers. 

RGB color values are supported in all browsers.

An RGB color value is specified with: rgb(red, green, blue).

Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color as an integer between 0 and 255.

For example, rgb(0, 0, 255) is rendered as blue, because the blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.

Simply look at the color given to you and by looking at codes and by looking at the graph below, choose the right color.
